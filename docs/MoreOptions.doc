1. Click on Three dots icon,let's say for playlist, SongsListItem.js.
2. On clicking this sets a prop coming from parent(PlaylistSongsList.js) setShowOptions=track_id, else sets to be false if it is already the selected row. 
3. In SongsListItem.js, created a variable called "showOptionsRow" which checks if the id set in the "setShowOptions" is same as the row track id, if yes then true else false.
4. Based on this variable(showOptionsRow) show modal of that row. 
5. If this variable(showOptionsRow) is true, then it adds a class to the row "row-hovered" which gives hovering effect to the selected row.
